# Dynamic-Height-Adjustment-based-on-Green-color-Detection

A real-time height adjustment system was developed utilizing a ZED 2i stereo camera, linear actuators, and an NVIDIA Jetson module operating on Ubuntu 20.04. The system detects green areas and adjusts the length of the linear actuators in real time to control the height of the end-effector.
